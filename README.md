[00:23.65] Sunday morning, man
[00:51.36] She woke up fightin' mad
[01:03.36] 
[00:56.70] Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
[00:59.69] 'Bout the time I had
[01:02.70] And by Tuesday you could say
[01:06.99] That girl was good as gone
[01:10.26] Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
[01:18.85] So I went for a drive to clear my mind
[01:22.99] Ended up at a Shell on I-65
[01:36.49] 
[01:27.49] Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
[01:32.33] I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
[01:36.51] She swore they were a waste of time
[01:39.06] Oh, but she was wrong
[01:49.56] 
[01:42.40] I was caller number five on a radio station
[01:47.27] Won a four day, three night beach vacation
[01:50.89] Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
[01:57.14] And I ain't gotta see my
[01:59.40] Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
[02:03.72] Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
[02:19.22] 
[02:12.90] Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
[02:20.41] When she heard about my newfound luck
[02:23.93] On that FM dial
[02:28.21] And it's crazy how lately now
[02:30.84] It just seems to come in waves
[02:35.55] What I thought was gonna be the death of me
[02:39.10] Was my saving grace
[02:43.32] It's got me thinkin' that her leavin'
[02:46.62] Is the only logical reason
[02:59.62] 
[02:50.56] That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
[02:54.63] And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
[02:58.56] She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
[03:05.31] And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
[03:09.69] Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
[03:13.46] For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
[03:20.38] And I ain't gotta see my
[03:22.39] Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
[03:26.05] Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
[03:31.55] When it rains it pours
[03:42.55] 
[03:35.95] Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
[03:39.74] For three weeks now
[03:42.94] And it all started on the day that she walked out
[04:07.44] 
[03:48.78] Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
[03:55.24] Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
[03:58.62] She swore they were a waste of time
[04:01.78] Oh, but she was wrong
[04:05.22] And I was caller number five on a radio station
[04:10.03] Won a four day three night beach vacation
[04:13.75] Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
[04:20.27] And I ain't gotta see my
[04:22.58] Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
[04:25.59] Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
[04:41.09] 
[04:30.89] When it rains it pours
