I am looking past the clouds in the sky
And there's no end in sight
Trying to see past this despondency
I'm wandering from everything

Losing hope, feeling numb and pale
It won't end - just like the stars, floating far
Misperceived this apathetic world
Should've known that when it rains it pours

Just like the ocean's waves (it won't let up)
I'm waiting for another day

Tonight I am sinking beneath the reach of all light
Goodbye
