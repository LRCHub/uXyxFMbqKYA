This is such a bitter pill to take
I will swallow my own pride but there's more at stake
I never saw my life as a losing game
But no matter what I do it'll remain the same
It's only now I recall, it's the winner who takes it all and just one in a million who gets to savor it all

When it rains it pours, oh no
All that was mine now is yours
When it rains it pours, oh no
You take it all with no remorse
Why is it so?
Isn't so?

If I had the strength I'd wish you well
But as hard as I can try I won't break the spell
I never thought of life as a waiting game
But I can't seem to move ahead, let alone sustain

It's only know I percieve what it feels like to leave... You were the one in a million who could make me believe...

When it rains it pours, oh no
All that was mine now is yours
When it rains it pours, oh no
You take it all with no remorse
Why is it so?
Isn't so?

Love me less and you love me better
I can still hear you say:
"Lonelyness or lonely never"
No rain will wash you away...

When it rains it pours, oh no
All that was mine now is yours
When it rains it pours, oh no
You take it all with no remorse
Why is it so?
Isn't so?
Why is it so?
Isn't so?
